                            satellite to study oscillations in massive stars The
                            baseline mission includes a 75mm refractive camera
                            feeding detectors in both NUV and visible
                            wavelengths. Detectors are photon-counting
                            sealed-tube micro-channel plates combined with
                            onboard preprocessing to limit the required data
                            rate. The mission would observe roughly 6 Milky Way
                            fields over a 2-year period.

                            We are using “wide binaries” to test models for
                            gyrochronology, the idea that the stellar rotation
                            rate can be used as a proxy for stellar age. In such
                            wide binaries, the two components don’t interact
                            with one another, and thus if gyrochronology works
                            both should show the same rotationally-determined
                            age. We are collaborating with Terry Oswalt, Tomomi
                            Otani, and Ted Von Hipple (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
                            University) to carry out this project using K2 and
                            TESS data, and the FGCU team has developed a tool
                            for measuring rotation periods based on light curves
                            using a variety of different methods.

                            GRBs are the most luminous events in the universe,
                            and are believed to represent the coalescence of a
                            binary neutron star or the collapse of a single
                            neutron star into a black hole. Choosing between the
                            various models for the event would be made easier if
                            we could detect such a system prior to the actual
                            GRB event, and we are searching the TESS images of
                            the full sky to find any such precursors.

                            We are nearing completion of a long-term study

                            using (and comparing) multiple approaches for the
                            analysis. We are also conducting uniform
                            high-resolution spectroscopy of our candidate stars
                            using the 3.5m telescope at Apache Point, NM, in

                            X-ray and UV emission from our target stars. In the
                            last year, we have broadened the project to include
                            analysis of TESS solar analogs/twins with

                            working on a number of projects combining
                            asteroseismic analysis of exoplanet host stars with

                            stars with known rotation periods. I have developed
                            an algorithm for producing light curves from the
                            TESS observations which can have noise levels as
                            much as 20% less than the standard product and am

                            Derek is using the TESS data to examine about 100 active
                            binary stars of the RS CVn and BY Dra type. These
                            are close binaries which, because of their
                            interaction, don’t spindown with time the way single
                            stars do, and thus serve as laboratories for stellar
                            activity such as spots and flares. This work is a

                            Derek delivered a fiber-fed astronomical spectrograph
                            for use on the Apache Point Observatory 0.5m
                            telescope, and we have successfully installed and
                            tested the instrument. Final checkout has been
                            delayed due to COVID, but we anticipate the
                            spectrograph becoming available as a facility
                            instrument this fall. We are renovating the FGCU
                            0.4-meter telescope for use as an instrument
                            testbed, and plan to use it with a high-speed camera
                            for exoplanet imagining and with an
                            ultra-high-resolution fiber spectrograph (using
                            virtual phased array technology) prior to hosting
                            that instrument on a larger telescope at a better
                            site. The upgrades to the observatory will also
                            enable it to return to use as a public outreach
                            site.
